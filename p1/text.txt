There is a piece of paper on the floor...
Sea Foam

Listen…
To my voice…
My shouting, bellowing voice…

Here I am
Pouring my blood into my words
Yelling at the very edge of the world…

I am the little mermaid…
Unable to return, the little mermaid…
Fated to foam, the little mermaid…

This appears to be a poem.
